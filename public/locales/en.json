      "title": "Not Perfect — But Progress",
      "content": "<p class=\"text-gray-400\">I was born on September 16, 2005, in Chaksikandar Mansurpur, Bihar — not a dusty old village story, not a poverty-driven beginning, but a childhood filled with comfort, family warmth, and every wish my parents could fulfill.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">My father worked in Saudi Arabia, and though he wasn’t always home, he made sure I never felt a lack of anything — not dreams, not support, not possibilities.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I didn’t grow up struggling for basics. I grew up learning the value of what I already had.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">A Move, A New Rhythm of Life</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">We later shifted to Hajipur, a town with more pace, more people, more exposure. I studied a year at Ideal Public School under Shahzad Sir — the first person who made me feel the weight and wonder of education.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">But my academic path was not linear.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I switched schools, restarted chapters, and eventually landed in St. Paul’s, the place that shaped a very raw version of me.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">The Phase When I Chose Excitement Over Direction</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Around Class 8, I drifted — not because of circumstances, but because of curiosity… and honestly, wrong choices.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I surrounded myself with the wrong kind of crowd. Drama looked cooler than discipline. Fights felt more powerful than focus. Ego felt like identity.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Suspensions came. More than five times.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I wasn’t a bad kid. Just a kid who didn’t know where he was heading.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Life didn’t stop me. It simply waited for me to outgrow that version of myself.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">10th Grade — The Quiet Reset</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">By Class 10, the noise inside me slowed down. I became calmer, quieter, a little lost… but more aware.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I scored 87.4% — not a reflection of my confusion, but of my potential.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">My family suggested moving to Pune, not out of necessity, but because they believed exposure brings clarity.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">And they were right.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">Pune — A New City, A Strange Pause</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I joined Akshara International for 11th and 12th. But then lockdown hit.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Classrooms turned into screens. Friends became icons. Life shrank into a room.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">My performance dipped. Not due to lack of resources, but because online life disconnects you from real learning.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Teachers gave extra classes, I tried catching up, and somehow passed 12th with 72%.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">The marks didn’t bother me. The confusion of “What now?” did.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">Kota — Not Struggle, But Intensity</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">With no clear direction, I took a drop year and moved to Kota for JEE preparation.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Kota wasn’t about poverty or pressure from life — it was about intensity, competition, and the feeling of swimming among thousands of dreamers at once.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I studied honestly. But results didn’t align with effort.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">After 8 months, my first attempt brought 66 percentile.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">And at the same time, I lost my grandfather.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I couldn’t attend his last rituals — not because we couldn’t afford to, but because flights weren’t operational and trains were delayed.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">The timing was cruel. The guilt stayed.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">Second Attempt — A Controlled Comeback</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I returned to Bihar, grounded and calmer. Studied again. Gave my second attempt.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">86 percentile.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Better. Still not enough.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">But I didn’t feel broken. I felt patient.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Some journeys aren’t meant to be shortcuts.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">One More Door — And Finally, It Opened</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">I appeared for MHT-CET, and this time scored 93 percentile.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">That number changed everything.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">It opened the doors of MIT-WPU Pune, and suddenly my life had direction, clarity, and a path worth walking.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">The boy who once chased noise started walking toward purpose.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">What My Journey Really Means</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">My life is not a struggle-for-survival story. It’s a story of self-awareness, of learning to choose better paths, of understanding how environment shapes you, and how mindset transforms you.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400 mt-4\">Here’s what I learned:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mt-2 space-y-2\"><li>Not every story needs pain. Some need growth.</li><li>Comfort doesn’t make you weak; confusion does.</li><li>Changing your circle can change your entire direction.</li><li>You don’t need to be perfect — just honest with yourself.</li></ul><p class=\"text-gray-400 mt-4\">And most importantly,</p><p class=\"text-center text-lg italic my-2 text-primary\">Where you come from matters less than who you choose to become.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-border/50\"><h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white\">I’m Not at My Peak. I’m at My Beginning.</h3><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Today, I’m in Pune, studying engineering, building skills, and becoming the version of myself I always sensed but never understood.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">My story isn’t about struggle. It’s about evolution.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Not about survival. But becoming.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">Not about lack. But learning.</p><p class=\"text-gray-400\">It’s real. It’s mine. And it’s still being written.</p>"
